Using python and a failed attempt with JavaScript forcing me to learn bs4:
- Takes URL from top of the script to calculate the sum of the mods in MB.
- The script will try to add linked collection's sizes but since this script doesn't 
try to calculate them, it registers as a mod but doesn't change the total value
